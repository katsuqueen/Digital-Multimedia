<h1>My School</h1>
<p>Junior undergraduate persuing a BFA in Illustration at University of New Haven. I transfered here in Fall 2019 after spending my first two years of college at Lyme Academy of Art in Old Lyme, CT.  My main college is in the Arts and Sciences in Dodds Hall where I have classes in Illustration and Graphic Design. In addition I am part of my college's anime and formerly psychology club. Occasionally on Fridays I work part-time for my parents at Nature Plus in Stratford, CT.  </p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>In my free time I like to cook, draw, and listen to music. In addition I take walks around the area for exercise. I'm also a huge fan of 90s-early 2000s cartoons and anime (such as Gravity Falls), and plan to one day create my own animation blog hopefully using coding skills. I have an account on Instagram where I post some of my artwork and connect with other students from Lyme. My special ability is giving amazing headscratches (according to my dad).<p>
